Today I’ll share tip No. 5 for creating a fast rise in real estate. First, though, let’s review the previous four tips that got us to where we are now:

1. Have clarity, know your goal, and create a business plan
2. Become a student of the business
3. Create a structural schedule
4. Have a daily prospecting goal&nbsp;

**Tip No. 5—the final tip in this series—is to be a leader.&nbsp;***Show* the knowledge you’ve gained by developing yourself in this industry. When you’re teaching, you’re also learning and cementing what you’ve learned (i.e., implementing). Become a leader in the industry and share your knowledge. This is what agents who’ve made a quantum leap in this industry have done to get to where they are: They’ve become leaders in the industry and shared their knowledge with their peers.&nbsp;

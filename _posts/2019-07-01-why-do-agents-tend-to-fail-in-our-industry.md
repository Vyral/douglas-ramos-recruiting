Today I’m joined by special guest JC to discuss an important, if sobering, topic: **Why do most real estate agents tend to fail out of the industry?** This marks the first part of my two-part series on the subject, where we’ll discuss the top 10 reasons agents leave the business.&nbsp;

So, why do most agents tend to fail, and what can be done about it? As it turns out, there are many, many reasons. In part one, we’ll cover just the first five.

**For our full conversation, view the video above, or else you can use the timestamps I’ve provided below to navigate the discussion at your leisure:**

In my 25 years of experience in the real estate business, I’ve been able to identify four key things that make up a great real estate agent:

1. **Desire**. In this business, you have to want it. You need to have that fire in your belly that will fuel you to find every possible way to succeed so that no obstacle is a game-ender. This applies to anything you want to accomplish, both in real estate and in real life.
2. **Discipline**. Many people get into the business thinking that they’ll be their own boss and they won’t have to drudge through a 9-to-5 schedule. Unfortunately, that can be a double-edged sword for agents who don’t know how to manage their time or don’t have the work ethic to hold themselves accountable. To succeed in our industry you need to do all the necessary tasks that will get you business, like prospecting, going on calls, follow-ups, and appointments. If you’re your own boss, you still need to treat your time as valuable.
3. **Training**. Training is necessary for all sales careers, and even though many people don’t think of Realtors as salespeople, we are. We just happen to be members of the Realtors Association who sell real estate. If you want to be great, you need to be trained in all aspects of the business so that you can grow your business however you need to.
4. **Skill**. Related to training, you’ll need to have a certain skill set to make it far in the business. For example, you’ll need to learn your scripts in order to convey the value that you bring to the business. And you’ll also need to recognize what skills are necessary; working with buyers requires different skills as opposed to working with sellers. Also, be sure to sharpen the skills you have every day. Pro athletes don’t go pro by *not* practicing daily.

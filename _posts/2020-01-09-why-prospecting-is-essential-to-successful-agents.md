So far, we’ve covered three ways to create a fast rise in the real estate industry: Having clarity and a business plan, becoming a student of the business, and having a structured schedule.

**Today I’m talking about point No. 4: Having a daily prospecting goal.** A lot of people associate prospecting with cold calling, but prospecting encompasses so much more than that, and it’s what you need to be doing in a sales industry like ours.

**Prospecting can take many different forms.** You could focus on cold calling, if you’re good at that. It could also include door knocking, networking, and connecting with people through social media. Prospecting just means talking to people every day about the services you provide.&nbsp;

It’s important to have a prospecting goal. The agents who rise quickly in this business understand that. **They create their goal and they execute.** That’s what you need to do, too.

Stay tuned for tip No. 5 in my next video. In the meantime, if you have any questions about the business or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;

  There’s a reason that certain agents rise to the top of the business and
  others do not. Having a clear, defined goal and business plan is one of them.

I’ve seen plenty of agents go from zero to hero in my 22 years in real estate, so today I’m going to share the first of five tips that I’ve identified to help you get there, too.&nbsp;

**It all starts with having a clear, defined goal.** You’d be surprised how many agents don’t really know what their goals are with real estate when they get into the business. Not having a business plan is why many of them fail. Those who do have a solid plan are the ones who rise quickly to the top.

If you were going to drive from the east coast to the west coast, you wouldn't get into the car without mapping the route. That’s what happens when an agent doesn’t have a defined goal, clarity, or a business plan that lays out the route that you will take to get to your goal.&nbsp;

**Whether you’re brand-new or a seasoned agent, having that clear, defined business plan will get you started on the right path.&nbsp;**

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;

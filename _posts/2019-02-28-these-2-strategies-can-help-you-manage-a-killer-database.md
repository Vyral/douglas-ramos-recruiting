Have you been managing your database lately?

Many agents make the mistake of not paying enough attention to their past clients and building on those connections. Instead, they focus all of their energy on pursuing new clients.&nbsp;

If you haven’t given much thought to how important it is to keep your present customers, remember this statistic that I mentioned in the previous video of this series: According to SourceLink.com, **even a 5% increase in customer retention can increase your profitability by 75%.** Why not take care of the clients and customers who already know, like, and trust you?&nbsp;

With that in mind, here are a couple more strategies you can use to grow your business by creating and managing a killer database:&nbsp;

* **Consider a “Five-a-Day**” contact program. It’s always easier to take small steps that will make a big impact. Start your day with a colorful piece of paper with five past clients, referral sources, or prospects. Make five touches and call every day, five days a week, and you’ll end each month with a healthy rotation through your database. The number of touches should be close to 100 calls. Your script doesn’t have to be complicated.&nbsp;
* **Send a note.** If you’re embarrassed about not staying in touch, think about sending a fun note and include a call to action to get any information about neighborhood news or any real estate activity in your area.&nbsp;

Again, we hope today’s message has been helpful, and be sure to look out for my next episode for even more great information.&nbsp;

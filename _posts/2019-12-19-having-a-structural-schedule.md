Now that you know the first two tips to creating a fast rise in real estate, it’s time for tip No. 3: **Have a structural schedule.&nbsp;**

A lot of agents take this for granted and don’t really know what having a structural schedule means. As an independent contractor, you can structure your time any way you want, but that can sometimes be a double-edged sword. By this, I mean you can end up working in reaction mode. If something happens, you react. If you get a call from a buyer, you’ll stop what you’re doing and show them a property because that’s what keeps you busy.&nbsp;

This is in contrast to having a structural schedule in place that outlines the times you prospect, show properties, and handle your paperwork. **Agents who go from zero to 60 in a short time understand that having a structural schedule in place is key.&nbsp;**

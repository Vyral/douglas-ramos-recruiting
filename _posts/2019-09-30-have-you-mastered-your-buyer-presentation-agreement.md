Buyer agreements are also an excellent risk management tool; if agents have a firm grasp of what they should and shouldn’t do in various situations and can explain that to clients, they’re less likely to invite complaints (or litigations).

So why are agents so resistant to using an exclusive buyer agreement? In my opinion, there are two emotions at play.

Fear. Both buyers and agents alike experience a fear of commitment. Buyers don’t want to be locked in, whereas agents worry about the buyers trying to suck up all their time. Agents also worry about asking for a signed agreement—it could drive buyers away, especially if these agreements aren’t commonly used in your market.<br>Trust. Some agents would rather trust their clients and want to build their relationships based on trust. To them, I ask, “Is trust established merely by a matter of building rapport? Or does establishing trust also entail demonstrating that you’re professional, knowledgeable, and capable of helping buyers achieve their goals?” That’s the kind of trust that builds confidence, which is fully supported by the buyer representation agreement.

So how do you overcome these hurdles?

The first step is to educate your buyers about you and your team’s roles and responsibilities in the transaction as well as the buyer’s. Make sure that your consultation answers all the buyer’s questions and concerns. It’s important to practice and roleplay this presentation to truly convey your competence to your buyer because if you master your buyer presentation, you’ll have a higher chance of your buyer actually signing that exclusive buyer agreement.

Ask your broker to provide you with a buyer presentation, and if they don’t have one, reach out to me. I’ll be happy to send you mine.

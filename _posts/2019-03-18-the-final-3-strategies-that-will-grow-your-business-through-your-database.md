If you’ve been following my three-part series about the importance of leveraging your database (parts one and two you can watch **[here](https://c21arcoaching.com/5-reasons-to-follow-up-with-your-past-clients.html){: target="_blank"}**&nbsp;and **[here](https://c21arcoaching.com/these-2-strategies-can-help-you-manage-a-killer-database.html){: target="_blank"}**), you know that there are several effective strategies in which you can use your database to grow your business.&nbsp;

Now, for the final installment, here are three more strategies that will help you in this regard:

**1. Throw a party.** For example, every year during the summer, one of the most successful agents in the Chicagoland area throws a fun party for their past clients and current strategic partners, with plenty of activities for kids to enjoy as well. Regardless of when their clients bought or sold a home, they know they’re getting invited. They also invite their lenders and support contractors to share in the fun. Local permits for this kind of thing are inexpensive, so it’s a win-win situation for everyone involved.&nbsp;

**2. Be visible in your community.** Set up a charity event in your local town that will keep your name top of mind!

**3. Be a resource**. Set up a monthly or quarterly seminar so people can learn what they need to do to buy or sell real estate. Better yet, make it a joint venture with a local attorney, title company, church, etc. so you can meet even more people who will help expand your database. If you consistently update your most valuable asset—your prospects—you can be assured that you’ll never have to “clean house” again, and you’ll be able to leverage the power of your influence.&nbsp;

How do you stay connected with past clients? There are a few proven ways to do this as well.

As new technology emerges to help spread information, your options to stay connected with your clients also increase. In terms of staying connected, **video content is king**—it’s always easier for clients to put a face to your name if they can see you in a video in an email, on your website, or on a social media account. Many agents are embracing video to not only showcase their top listings, but also their profiles. Nothing can top the benefits of becoming a recognizable face in your community, especially when it comes to your business.&nbsp;

Also, **don’t forget to personalize your communication**. Make yourself an authentic resource. People want to be treated like individuals—not as part of a demographic—and the best agents agree that real estate is less about properties and more about people. Listen to the stories your clients tell you, engage them, and build on that professional connection. Professionalism is greatly appreciated in terms of cold, hard business, but the personal touch is what really leaves a mark with your clients.&nbsp;

Lastly, **tell a story with every interaction**. While ongoing communication used to be geared toward providing information in a quick, dry way, recent research shows that people respond much better to stories than cold, hard facts. Try to condense a little narrative into your emails and give your clients the feeling that plenty of interesting stuff has happened during the time you haven’t been in touch that they would love to hear about.&nbsp;

Once again, if you have any questions about this topic or you’d like to talk further about how you can grow your business through your database, feel free to call or email me anytime. I’d love to speak with you.

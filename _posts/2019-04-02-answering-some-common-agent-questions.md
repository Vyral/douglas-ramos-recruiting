I recently went live on Facebook to talk about real estate, the market, and to answer all the questions that I’ve been hearing lately from agents in the area. **Here’s an outline of the video, with timestamps so that you can skip ahead to the question(s) that interest you the most:**

0:45- Are all leads the same?<br>3:00- Is a lead a lead no matter what?<br>5:15- How can you track your conversion rate better?<br>6:15- A final lead tracking tip for agents out there

If you have any questions for me about anything I discussed in the video above or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;

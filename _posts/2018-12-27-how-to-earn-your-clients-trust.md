A trusting relationship is important, especially when it comes to real estate. Today we’ll be discussing how you can build trust with your clients.

In real estate, important things can happen quickly, so the relationships between an agent and their clients must be built on trust. **Trust building begins immediately in the first interaction**—ensuring you’re all on the same team allows you to work together to accomplish real estate goals.

**So, how can we get clients who we’ve just met to trust us?**

Referrals from friends and family do wonders. You’ll have a better chance of starting off on the right foot, but the first impression you make is still important. Also, professionals with a reputation for being ethical can earn trust more easily.

**The three R’s of respect are vital elements of earning trust:**

**1. Recognition.** When an agent doesn’t recognize the value in a prospective client, the client won’t recognize the value in the agent, either. Make it clearly evident you are aware of the value they carry.<br>**2. Reliability.** You and your team members must be predictable, reliable, and follow through with clients.<br>**3. Resourcefulness.** Prospective clients want to find professionals who put clients’ interests first. You must do what it takes to get the job done.

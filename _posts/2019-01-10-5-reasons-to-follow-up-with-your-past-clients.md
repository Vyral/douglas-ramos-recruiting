Welcome to the first installment into our three-part series on the importance of having a database. During this series, we’ll also cover 10 proven strategies to help you grow your real estate business.&nbsp;

When talking to fellow real estate agents, it is always surprising to learn that many of them either don’t spend much time working on their database or don’t have one at all.&nbsp;

Many agents who are guilty of this may have a software program that houses a database, but they fail to utilize it. They don’t employ any sort of engagement strategy in order to nurture contacts and keep them liable, nor do they implement any sort of ongoing business growth strategies. &nbsp;

**Any successful business knows that your customers are your most important asset.** The process of buying or selling does not end at the closing. When nurtured and serviced after the sale, your client relationship opens the door to easier prospecting, endless referrals and repeat business.

In case you haven’t thought about why it’s important to keep your present customers, here’s a statistic that will convince you: SourceLink.com reports that even a “5% increase in customer retention can increase profitability by 75%”.&nbsp;

If this statistic alone isn’t enough to convince you of the value of staying in touch with clients who already know, like, and trust you, consider these five additional reasons you should do so:&nbsp;

**1. Customers are your most important asset.** While the closing table may signal the end of a particular transaction, it shouldn’t represent the end of your relationship with a given client. Think of closing, instead, as a gateway to future business. To maintain client relationships, though, you will need a system that can deliver consistent, systematic contact features to help keep your brand and name in front of your database. There are countless real estate software programs that can help organize your contacts before, during, and long after a transaction has closed. Explore your options to see which platform works best for your business.

<br>**2. It’s easier to sell to existing customers.** According to MarketingMetrics.com, you have a 60% chance of selling to an existing customer, but a mere 5% to 20% chance of successfully selling to a new one. Therefore, you should never neglect your past clients when nurturing contacts. &nbsp;Take at least one day per week to work on your database. Start from the current year and work backward to organize, review, and upload customer information so you can begin the process of contacting, nurturing, and informing.

<br>**3. You can save five times more on marketing.** Nurturing existing relationships is significantly less expensive than developing new ones; Forrester Research reports that, in today’s market, it costs five times more to acquire a customer than it does to keep current ones. Using a client relationship management system (CRM) is critical if you hope to continually nurture and maintain strong relationships with past clients. Ideally, the relationships you make with clients should be lifelong ones.&nbsp;

<br>**4. There are plenty of easy, inexpensive ways to build an effective database.** Despite this, many agents are so busy working with current prospects that they can’t keep up with prospecting for new customers. If your present website isn’t working 24/7, you will lose the prospecting and marketing edge. Even something as simple as having a website that uses effective lead capture features coupled with ongoing communication and marketing messaging can help you stay connected with your prospects during the incubation process.

<br>**5. Old customers are a great source of business.** Following up with past clients will remind them to think of you when they or someone they know needs your services in the future. A good old-fashioned phone call and handwritten thank-you note can, and often will, do the trick. Once you’ve reignited the relationship, be ready to continue the engagement with consistent communication touches to keep the connection warm. Set up a marketing calendar and schedule recurring follow-up engagements at least once a month. Offering valuable information through market reports, incentivizing engagement with gift card giveaways, or hosting seasonal competitions or small social events will help you stay top-of-mind with past clients.&nbsp;

Today I’m joined by Gaby to answer some burning questions that are specific to agent training, how training can be an instrument for greater education and growing your business, and the kind of training that keeps an agent on track to succeed. &nbsp;&nbsp;

**Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video.** Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to browse specific topics at your leisure:&nbsp;

0:26—Does my real estate education end once I receive my license?&nbsp;

1:53—How often should I do additional training?&nbsp;

3:00—Should my team leader or brokerage offer additional training?&nbsp;

6:30—What kind of training does my firm provide?&nbsp;

If you have any questions that pertain to today’s topic or if you’d like me to answer some other pressing question on your mind, I’d be more than happy to do so in one of my future videos. You can reach me by phone at 908-494-4611 or by email at DouglasR@C21AR.net. I look forward to further educating and empowering you\!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;

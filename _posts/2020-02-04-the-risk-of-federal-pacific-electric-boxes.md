Today I would like to address something that has been coming up quite a bit: Federal Pacific electric boxes. Federal Pacific electrical breaker boxes are a type of electrical panel to distribute power to the circuit breakers in your home. They possess an underlying risk; the circuit breakers may fail to trip in the case of an overload or a short circuit. A circuit breaker that fails to trip could cause a fire or personal injury.&nbsp;

A question I’ve received a lot is: Should Federal Pacific boxes be inspected or replaced before putting my house on the market? **No, they do not need to be inspected because they&nbsp;*****do*** **need to be replaced.** Due to their long history of issues, if you have one of these electric panels in your home or you’re buying a home with one of these panels, you need to have it replaced.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about Federal Pacific electric boxes or concerning real estate in general, please reach out to me by phone or email. I would love to speak with you.
